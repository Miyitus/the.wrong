<br>what can I do with the wrong router ?
<p>now you can walk into MOMA with your device, and host your digital art show in the same room as roy lichtenstein, jackson pollock or salvador dalí. or while snacking in central park. or while dancing in your favourite club’s bathroom. or while commuting, or even while in heavy traffic. and yes, your show joins the official program of the wrong.</p>
